#A Seat at the Table

<center>* * *</center>

Sarah smoothed her hands down the front of her navy blue dress, taking a deep breath as she surveyed the familiar sanctuary. The warm glow of the overhead lights cast a cozy ambiance, and the air was thick with the scent of freshly polished wood and lingering incense. Despite the hundreds of times she had sat in these pews, a sense of anticipation always filled her on Maundy Thursday.

As the organist began to play the opening hymn, Sarah's gaze drifted to the altar, where the communion table stood ready, draped in a crisp white linen cloth. The simple yet profound symbolism of that table, the site of the Last Supper, never failed to stir something deep within her.

Sarah felt a gentle squeeze on her hand and turned to see her husband, Tom, offering her a reassuring smile. "You ready?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

She nodded, letting her fingers intertwine with his as they rose to their feet, joining the congregation in song. Though her mind was often preoccupied with the stresses of daily life—work, bills, the kids' schedules—in this moment, Sarah felt a profound sense of peace wash over her.

As the service progressed, the pastor's words resonated with Sarah in a way they hadn't in a long time. He spoke of the significance of the Last Supper, of Jesus gathering his disciples around that table, offering them comfort, fellowship, and a final meal together before his crucifixion.

"In that moment," the pastor said, his voice rich with emotion, "Jesus was reminding them—and us—that we all have a seat at the table of God's family. No matter our struggles, our doubts, or our failings, we are welcome to partake in the blessings of community and the grace of our Savior."

Sarah felt a lump form in her throat as tears threatened to spill down her cheeks. She had been feeling so distant from God, so adrift in her own worries and insecurities, that the idea of having a place at the table—a place of belonging and purpose—was a balm to her weary soul.

As the congregation filed forward to receive communion, Sarah and Tom approached the altar hand-in-hand. When the pastor placed the wafer in her palm and uttered the familiar words, "The body of Christ, broken for you," Sarah couldn't hold back the flood of emotions that washed over her.

In the days following the Maundy Thursday service, Sarah found herself contemplating the significance of the Last Supper more deeply. She pored over the gospels, re-reading the accounts of Jesus' final meal with his disciples, searching for guidance and meaning.

One evening, as she sat at the kitchen table, her Bible open in front of her, Tom entered the room and placed a mug of steaming tea beside her. "You've been awfully quiet lately," he said, pulling out a chair and sitting down across from her.

Sarah offered him a small smile. "I've just been thinking a lot about that service on Thursday, and what it all means." She paused, worrying her lower lip between her teeth. "I feel so...lost, sometimes, Tom. Like I'm just going through the motions, without any real connection to my faith."

Tom reached across the table and covered her hand with his own. "I know, honey. I've felt that way too, if I'm being honest." He sighed heavily. "With work and the kids and everything else, it's easy to let our faith slip to the back burner, isn't it?"

Sarah nodded, grateful for his understanding. "The pastor talked about having a seat at the table, and it just resonated with me so deeply. I want to feel that sense of belonging again, to really be a part of God's family. But sometimes, it feels like I'm on the outside, looking in."

Tom squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Well, then, let's find our way back to that table together. I don't want either of us to feel alone in this." He paused, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. "You know, the Last Supper was all about Jesus gathering his closest friends and followers around that table, right? He wanted them to feel connected, to know that they were part of something bigger than themselves."

Sarah nodded, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Yes, that's exactly it. He was offering them comfort and community, even in the face of his own impending suffering."

"Maybe that's what we need to focus on," Tom said, his voice soft. "Finding that sense of community, of belonging, within our own marriage and our family. And letting our faith be the foundation that supports us, no matter what challenges come our way."

Sarah felt a wave of gratitude wash over her as she reached across the table to entwine her fingers with Tom's. "I think you're right. And I'm ready to start rebuilding that foundation, together."

Over the next several weeks, Sarah and Tom made a concerted effort to prioritize their faith and their relationship. They began setting aside time each evening to read the Bible and pray together, sometimes joined by their two teenage children, Sarah and David.

As they explored the stories of the Last Supper and the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion, Sarah found herself drawing parallels to her own life. The sense of betrayal and abandonment that the disciples must have felt, the uncertainty and fear—these were all emotions she had grappled with in her own spiritual journey.

But along with those difficult feelings, Sarah also found solace in the unwavering love and forgiveness that Jesus demonstrated, even in his final hours. "This is my body, broken for you," he had told his disciples, offering them a tangible reminder of the sacrifice he was about to make.

As Sarah and Tom discussed these biblical accounts, they couldn't help but reflect on their own relationship and the ways they had, at times, fallen short of the ideal. There had been moments of distance, of misunderstanding, of taking each other for granted.

"But just like Jesus forgave his disciples," Tom said one evening, "we need to be willing to forgive each other. To come back to that table, no matter how many times we've wandered away."

Sarah nodded, her eyes shining with a renewed sense of hope. "And to remember that we're not alone. That we have a place at the table, as part of God's family." She reached across the table to squeeze Tom's hand. "I don't want to take that for granted anymore."

In the days leading up to Easter, Sarah and Tom continued to deepen their spiritual connection, finding strength and comfort in their shared faith. When they entered the church on Easter morning, hand-in-hand, their faces were filled with a sense of purpose and belonging that had been missing for far too long.

As the congregation sang the joyous hymns celebrating Christ's resurrection, Sarah felt a profound sense of gratitude. She had once again found her seat at the table, not just in the church, but in her marriage and her relationship with God. And with Tom by her side, she knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, as a family united in their faith.

##Tom's Reflection: 

As the pastor of Cornerstone Church, I have had the privilege of walking alongside countless individuals and families on their spiritual journeys. Whether it's providing counsel during times of crisis, guiding couples through the challenges of marriage, or offering a compassionate ear to those grappling with doubts and uncertainties, my role is to be a beacon of hope and a bridge between the divine and the human.

The story of Sarah and Tom Rhodes is one that resonates deeply with me, for it speaks to the universal human need for belonging, purpose, and a sense of connection – both with God and with one another. As I read through the events that unfolded in the days leading up to Easter, I couldn't help but see parallels to the experiences of the many congregants I have had the honor of serving over the years.

At the heart of this story is the profound symbolism of the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion. In that moment, Jesus was not just breaking bread and sharing wine – he was extending an invitation, a reminder that all who follow him have a seat at the table of God's family. It is a powerful image, one that speaks to the universal human longing for community, for acceptance, and for a place where we can truly belong.

As a pastor, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of this message. So often, the people who come to me for guidance and support are grappling with a deep sense of spiritual disconnect, a feeling of being adrift in a world that seems increasingly chaotic and uncertain. They may have grown up in the church, but somewhere along the way, their faith has become more of a ritual than a living, breathing part of their daily lives.

This is precisely the situation that Sarah found herself in, and it is a struggle that I have seen time and time again. In a world that is constantly demanding our time and attention, it is all too easy to let our spiritual well-being take a backseat to the pressing concerns of work, family, and everyday life. And when that happens, we can find ourselves feeling lost, disconnected, and unsure of our place in the grand scheme of things.

But as Sarah's story reminds us, it is never too late to find our way back to the table. Through the guidance and wisdom of her pastor, Sarah was able to rediscover the profound significance of the Last Supper and the deep well of meaning and purpose that it holds. In that moment, she was reminded that she was not alone, that she had a place at the table – not just as a member of the church, but as a beloved child of God.

This is the message that I strive to impart to my own congregation, day in and day out. It is not enough to simply show up and go through the motions of faith; we must actively cultivate a sense of belonging, a deep and abiding connection to the divine and to one another. And as a pastor, it is my responsibility to guide my flock towards that goal, to be a steadfast presence in their lives and to help them navigate the often-turbulent waters of spiritual growth and transformation.

In the case of Sarah and Tom, I see the power of this message playing out in real time. As they rediscover the importance of their faith and their family, they are not only strengthening their own bond, but they are also setting an example for their children – a testament to the transformative power of community, forgiveness, and a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves.

This is the kind of spiritual journey that I have the privilege of witnessing and supporting time and time again. Whether it's helping a young couple navigate the challenges of parenthood, guiding a grieving family through the process of healing, or simply offering a listening ear and a compassionate heart to those who are struggling, my role as a pastor is to be a conduit for the grace and love of God – to help people find their way back to the table, and to remind them that they are never alone.

In the end, that is the true power of the Last Supper, and the message that I strive to convey in my own ministry. It is a reminder that, no matter how far we may wander, no matter how lost or disconnected we may feel, there is always a place for us at the table of God's family. And it is my honor and my privilege to be a part of that journey, to walk alongside those who are seeking to rebuild their faith and their relationships, and to help them find the strength, the courage, and the community they need to thrive.
