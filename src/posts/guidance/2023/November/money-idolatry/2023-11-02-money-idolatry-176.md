"We need to talk," Lisa said, her voice tense as she entered the study where David sat hunched over his laptop, typing furiously.

David glanced up, his brow furrowing. "Can it wait? I'm in the middle of an important call."

Lisa crossed her arms, her gaze unwavering. "No, it can't. This is about our family."

Letting out a frustrated sigh, David closed his laptop and turned to face his wife. "Alright, what is it?"

"It's Ethan and Lily. They're—" Lisa paused, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "They're slipping away from us, David. All we do is work and spend money on things we don't need. When was the last time we actually sat down and had a real conversation with them?"

David's expression softened, but only for a moment. "I know, I know. But you know how important it is for me to provide for this family. We need to maintain our lifestyle, keep up appearances. You're the one who's always pushing for the latest gadgets and designer clothes."

"That's not the point, David!" Lisa exclaimed, her voice rising. "Our children are hurting, and all we care about is money and status. When was the last time we took them on a family vacation, or had a game night instead of another dinner party?"

The guilt in David's eyes was palpable, but he quickly tried to dismiss it. "Look, I'm doing the best I can. I'm trying to secure our family's future. Isn't that what's important?"

"No, David," Lisa said, her voice soft but firm. "What's important is being there for our children, showing them that they matter more than any material possession. We're losing them, and I can't bear the thought of it."

David opened his mouth to respond, but the sound of a door slamming upstairs cut him off. Ethan's heavy footsteps thundered down the stairs, his face twisted in a scowl.

"Ethan, where are you going?" Lisa asked, her heart sinking.

"Out," Ethan spat, grabbing his car keys. "Anywhere but here."

"Ethan, wait!" David called out, but the teenager was already out the door, leaving a tense silence in his wake.

Lisa turned to David, her eyes pleading. "Don't you see? This is exactly what I'm talking about. We're losing our family, and if we don't do something soon, we might never get them back."

David ran a hand through his hair, his expression conflicted. "I—I don't know what to do, Lisa. I'm trying, but it's just so hard to juggle everything."

"Then let's figure it out, together," Lisa said, placing a hand on his arm. "We need to make some changes, David. Our family is more important than any business deal or fancy party."

David nodded slowly, his gaze shifting to the framed family portrait on the wall. "You're right. I... I don't want to lose them. We have to try."

Just then, the sound of a door slamming upstairs drew their attention. Lily emerged, her eyes red from crying, and rushed past them without a word.

Lisa reached out, but Lily shrugged off her touch. "Lily, honey, what's wrong?"

Lily paused, her voice quivering. "Nothing. I just want to be alone."

As Lily disappeared into her room, David and Lisa exchanged a weighted look, the weight of their neglect settling heavily on their shoulders. The once-vibrant household had become a cold, disconnected place, and they knew they had to take action before their family slipped away for good.

"Pastor Tom, thank you for seeing me on such short notice," Lisa said, her voice trembling as she settled into the chair across from the kind-eyed man.

Tom Rhodes leaned forward, his expression warm and inviting. "Of course, Lisa. I'm always here to listen and offer guidance. What's been troubling you?"

Lisa took a deep breath, her gaze dropping to her hands folded in her lap. "It's our family, Pastor. David and I, we've become so consumed by money and material things, we've lost sight of what's truly important." Her voice wavered, a hint of guilt and anguish seeping through.

Tom nodded, his eyes reflecting empathy. "Tell me more about what you've been experiencing. I'm here to listen without judgment."

"It's just—" Lisa paused, her brow furrowing. "David's always working, chasing the next big deal or investment. And I, I'm no better. I'm always wanting the latest gadgets, the most expensive clothes. We've become so obsessed with keeping up appearances, with showing off our wealth, that we've completely neglected our children."

She looked up, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Ethan and Lily, they're slipping away from us, Pastor. They feel ignored, unloved. And the worst part is, I can see it, but I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to make them feel like they matter more than any material possession."

Tom reached across the desk, gently placing his hand over Lisa's. "I understand, Lisa. It's a common trap that many families fall into, especially those with the means to accumulate wealth and possessions. But at the end of the day, those things are hollow, empty."

He paused, his gaze steady and reassuring. "Tell me, what do you and David value most? What are the core beliefs and principles that guide your lives?"

Lisa bit her lip, her brow furrowing in thought. "Well, we grew up in families that placed a lot of importance on status and appearances. We were taught that success was measured by how much you had, not who you were. And I suppose we just... carried on that mentality, even after we got married."

She shook her head, a hint of shame in her expression. "But deep down, we both know that's not what's truly important. We want our children to grow up feeling loved and secure, not like they have to compete with our material possessions for our attention."

Tom nodded, his gaze thoughtful. "It sounds like you and David have lost touch with the deeper, spiritual aspects of your lives. The things that truly give life meaning and purpose."

He paused, his eyes searching Lisa's face. "Tell me, when was the last time you and your family spent time in prayer, or discussed your faith and its role in your lives?"

Lisa's shoulders slumped, a wave of guilt washing over her. "I... I can't even remember, Pastor. We used to go to church every Sunday, but lately it's just been one business event or social gathering after another. We've become so caught up in the rat race, we've forgotten what really matters."

Tom gave her hand a gentle squeeze. "Well, my dear, I think it's time to change that. Your family is in desperate need of reconnection - with each other, and with your faith. Only then can you begin to realign your priorities and find the balance you're seeking."

He leaned back in his chair, his expression thoughtful. "Now, I have a few suggestions that may help you and David get started. First and foremost, I encourage you both to set aside time each week for a family devotional. Let this be a sacred time where you can all come together, share your hearts, and seek guidance from the Lord."

Lisa nodded, a spark of hope igniting in her eyes. "That... that sounds like a wonderful idea, Pastor. I know David and the kids will need some convincing, but I'm willing to try anything at this point."

Tom smiled warmly. "Excellent. And I also recommend setting aside a regular 'family night' - no work, no distractions, just quality time together. Perhaps a game night, or a picnic in the park. Anything that encourages connection and togetherness."

He paused, his gaze turning more serious. "Additionally, I'd like you and David to consider scaling back on your material possessions and spending. Focus on what truly brings you joy and fulfillment, rather than what society tells you to value. This will help you realign your priorities and free up time and resources for your family."

Lisa nodded, her expression resolute. "I'll talk to David about all of this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to save our family."

Tom reached across the desk, placing his hand over hers once more. "I have faith in you, Lisa. With God's guidance and your determination, I believe you and David can find your way back to what truly matters. Now, let's discuss some specific communication techniques that can help you and your husband navigate this journey together..."

"David, we need to talk," Lisa said, her voice resolute as she entered their bedroom, where David sat on the edge of the bed, lost in thought.

David looked up, a hint of trepidation in his eyes. "What is it, Lisa? Is everything alright?"

Lisa took a deep breath, settling down beside him. "I... I went to see Pastor Tom today. I needed his guidance on what we can do to fix our family."

David's brow furrowed, but he remained silent, allowing Lisa to continue.

"David, we've been so caught up in this endless pursuit of wealth and material possessions, we've completely lost sight of what's truly important. Our children, our marriage, our faith—they've all been pushed aside in favor of keeping up appearances and maintaining a lavish lifestyle."

She reached out, placing her hand over his. "I don't want to live like this anymore, David. I want us to be a family again, not just two people who happen to share a house and a last name."

David's gaze dropped to their hands, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. "I know, Lisa. I know we've been neglecting the things that matter most. But I..." He paused, his expression conflicted. "I don't know how to change. I've spent my whole life chasing success, thinking that's what would make us happy."

"Well, Pastor Tom gave me some ideas on how we can start," Lisa said, her voice soft but firm. "First and foremost, he suggested we set aside time each week for a family devotional. A time where we can all come together, pray, and reconnect with our faith."

David looked up, his eyes widening slightly. "A family devotional? I... I don't know, Lisa. The kids, they might not be too keen on that."

Lisa squeezed his hand reassuringly. "I know, but we have to try. Ethan and Lily, they're hurting, David. They need to know that they matter more to us than any material possession or business deal."

David nodded slowly, the weight of his guilt evident in his expression. "You're right. I... I don't want to lose them, Lisa. They're the most important thing in the world to me."

"Then let's do this, together," Lisa said, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. "Pastor Tom also suggested we have a regular 'family night' - no work, no distractions, just quality time together. Maybe a game night, or a picnic in the park. Something to help us reconnect and rebuild that sense of unity."

David's expression softened, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. "That... that sounds like a good idea. And what about the material possessions? Pastor Tom had thoughts on that as well?"

"Yes," Lisa replied, her gaze turning more resolute. "He encouraged us to scale back on our spending and focus on what truly brings us joy and fulfillment, rather than what society tells us to value. We need to free up time and resources for our family."

David nodded, his brow furrowing in thought. "It won't be easy, letting go of all this. We've worked so hard to build this life."

"I know," Lisa said, her voice tinged with understanding. "But don't you see, David? This life we've built, it's hollow. It's not what's truly important. Our family, our faith, our connection with each other—that's what matters. And we can't keep sacrificing that for the sake of material wealth and status."

David was silent for a moment, his gaze shifting to the framed family portrait on the dresser. Slowly, he reached out and ran his fingers over the glass, a wistful expression crossing his face.

"You're right, Lisa. I don't want to lose this. I don't want to lose _us_." He turned to her, his eyes shining with renewed determination. "Let's do it. Let's make the changes, together. I'm ready to put our family first, no matter what it takes."

Lisa felt a wave of relief wash over her, and she pulled David into a tight embrace. "Oh, David, I'm so glad to hear you say that. I know it won't be easy, but I believe we can do this. As a family, we can find our way back to what truly matters."

As they held each other, the sound of footsteps on the stairs drew their attention. Ethan and Lily, both with wary expressions on their faces, hovered in the doorway, uncertain.

David and Lisa exchanged a meaningful glance, and then David opened his arms, beckoning his children to join them. "Come here, you two. We have something important to discuss as a family."

Tentatively, Ethan and Lily approached, and soon the four of them were wrapped in a tight embrace, the first step on their journey to reclaiming the true meaning of devotion.
